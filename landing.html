                        <h2>Paris City</h2>
                        <p>Paris is known for its gorgeous, imposing monuments. These iconic structures, often an exemplar of a particular era in architecture, are one of the city’s instantly recognizable elements.
                            The preeminent of Paris’s landmarks is the Eiffel Tower. This skyscraping wrought-iron needle became the world’s tallest building when it was unveiled at the 1889 Paris World’s Fair. Today, its summit remains the City of Light’s highest point.
                            Ascend to the top of the tower, feel the breeze, and explore Gustave Eiffel’s wood-paneled office-eyrie. Then revive yourself with a chilled glass of Veuve Clicquot at what must be a contender for the world’s highest Champagne Bar.

                        <h3>Is Paris bigger than London?</h3>
                        <p>The city is quite extensive in terms of square area. On the other hand, Paris is also a large city but way less than London in terms of area coverage.<br> Paris covers an estimated 105 square kilometers, which means London is 15 times larger than Paris.</p>

                        <p>Nowhere else on earth makes the heart swoon like the mention of Paris. The city lures with its magnificent art, architecture, culture, and cuisine, but there’s also a quieter magic waiting to be explored: the quaint cobbled lanes, the sweet patisseries around the corner, and the cosy little bistros that beckon with a glass of Beaujolais. Get ready to make Paris your own.</p>
